== Description ==

NG-Lazyload plugin replaces all the thumbails and images in the content with the smallest image possible (1 pixel gif) and then shows the full image only when it is in viewport.
The only plugin which also works with background images in style tag

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the archive on your computer
2. Upload plugin directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
